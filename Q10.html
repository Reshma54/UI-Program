        <b> <u>What is the Pointer ? </u></b><br>
    
                The Pointer in C, is a variable that stores address of another variable.
         A pointer can also be used to refer to another pointer function.
         A pointer can be incremented decremented, i.e., to point to the next/ previous memory location. 
         The purpose of pointer is to save memory space and achieve faster execution time.
</p>

<p  id="para1"; style="text-align: justify;" id="id2">
    <b>What is the array?</b><br>
    An array is a series of memory locations or 'boxes'each of which holds a single item of data,
     but with each box sharing the same name. 
     All data in an array must be of the same data type . 
     For example, imagine that a score table in a game needs to record ten scores.

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" id="id3">
    <b>What is the data type ? </b><br>
    A data type, in programming, is a classification that specifies 
    which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical,
     relational or logical operations can be applied to it without causing an error.

</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" id="id4">
    <b> What is the Structure ?</b><br>
    Structures (also called structs) are a way to group several related 
    variables into one place. Each variable in the structure is known as a member
     of the structure. Unlike an array, a structure can contain many different
      data types (int, float, char, etc.).


</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" id="id5">
    <b> What is the pointer to pointer ?</b><br>
    A pointer is used to store the address of variables. 
    So, when we define a pointer to pointer, the first pointer is used to store
     the address of the second pointer.

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" id="id6">
    <b> What is the literal ? </b><br>
    The literal meaning is the most obvious or non-figurative sense of
     a word or words. Language that's not perceived as metaphorical, ironic,
      hyperbolic, or sarcastic. Contrast with figurative meaning or non-literal
       meaning. Noun: literalness.17-Oct-2020

<p style="text-align: justify;" id="id7">
    <b> What is the character ? </b><br>
    The abbreviation char is used as a reserved keyword in some programming
     languages, such as C, C++, C#, and Java. It is short for character, 
     which is a data type that holds one character (letter, number, etc.) of data.
      For example, the value of a char variable could be any one-character value,
       such as 'A', '4', or '#'.31-Jan-2019

<p style="text-align: justify;" id="id8">
    <b>What is the integer ? </b><br>
    Integers are whole numbers that can have both zero, positive and 
    negative values but no decimal values. For example, 0 , -5 , 10. We can 
    use int for declaring an integer variable. int id; Here, id is a variable of
     type integer.


</p>

<p style="text-align:justify ;" id="id9">
    <b>What is the String ? </b><br>
    In C programming, a string is a sequence of characters terminated with 
    a null character \0 . For example: char c[] = "c string"; When the compiler
     encounters a sequence of characters enclosed in the double quotation marks,
      it appends a null character \0 at the end by default.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify ;" id="id10">
<b>What is the Single literal ? </b><br>
String literals. A string literal represents a sequence of characters that
 together form a null-terminated string. The characters must be enclosed between
  double quotation marks
